# shiny-introduction

Slides and code examples from my Research Coding Club tutorial on Building Interactive Web-apps in R with Shiny on 2021-02-17, which was later presented to the Bioinformatics monthly meeting on 2022-03-02.

This talk will introduce Shiny as a tool for making web-apps using R, provide examples of how this can help you share your research, and provide you with the skills required to get a basic web-app up and running by the end of the talk.

To follow along with the code examples during the tutorial, clone this repository onto your computer. 
You can either do this the usual way, or you can do it from within RStudio by clicking:

File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git -> Repository URL: `https://github.com/stulacy/shiny-introduction.git`

It's worth pulling the repo just before the talk in case I make any last minute changes (in RStudio, when the project is open click the blue down arrow in the top right `Git` panel).
